### Challenge

Without considering the UI design and using a video of your own choosing the intention is to replicate Instagramâ€™s cover frame picker (video attached). This consists in 2 main blocks:

- Generate a list of video screenshots in order to create the selection scrubber
- Show selected preview image on the main component

Please see attached version of Instagram's video select preview image as an example in the example.mp4 file
